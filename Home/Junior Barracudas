Junior Barracudas
The Junior Barracudas program is a great way to get younger kids into the water and give them a feel for what club is like without overtaxing them.

The Junior Barracudas practice from 6:15 - 6:45 pm, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. This shorter practice time allows them to ease into competitive swimming and practicing before the "bigger kids," and allows better one-on-one instruction in swimming techniques.

The program runs from the first day of practice, October 1st, 2019, through November 30th, 2019. This will allow them the opportunity to experience both a home and away meet.

At that point, any Junior can transition to a full club member with Coach and Parental approval.

Practices will then begin with the full club at 6:30 pm, but will end around 7:45 pm most days - dependent on age and Coach's discretion.  

Additional dues will be required: please see the registration page.
