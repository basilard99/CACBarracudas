Swim Lessons
***********

For Spring 2020 lessons are postponed at this time, as most things are.

Since we hold lessons at Carlynton High School we need to get their approval before we can reschedule. As soon as we can confirm pool availabilty and coaches too, we will update this site.

Feel Free to use the CONTACT US options if you would like to be added to any email updates.

Thank you for you patience.

We hope your household is well, and that we will see you at the pool soon!

***********************************

Lessons are offered at the following levels:

Beginner: Swimmer needs instructor assistance when in the water
Intermediate: Swimmer needs partial assistance when in the water
Advanced: Swimmer does not require assistance when in the water - pre-swim team
Swimmers get in the water with coaches and assistants. Viewing is from the bleachers at the poolside.

Lessons are available for district and non-district residents (with surcharge), 

for children ages 2 and up, as long as they are fully potty trained.

The cost is $150.00 for the series.

Deadline to register is Friday, March 27th and is first come first served.

Class enrollment will be capped based on safe instruction limitations.

Onsite registration will be accepted on March 30th if there is still space available, but there will be an additional 10$ fee for late registration, so don't delay!

Please contact the board via the Contact Us link above if you, or someone you know, is interested in lessons - we will send you the registration form.

Thank you for your interest!

Lifeguard Certifications
Older swimmers are often interested in becoming lifeguards. We are pleased to be able to offer training for this, but we partner with certified trainers to provide it. Details about this opportunity will generally be communicated near the end of the season. If interested, please contact the board.
